### 📍 Why this Project?

This project was born from the desire to create a useful and practical tool for daily life, focusing on digital security. The main goal was to deepen my knowledge in **JavaScript programming logic**, array manipulation, form events (checkboxes and numeric inputs), and creating a modern, responsive interface using CSS variables for a consistent color system. 🛠️
